*Creative. Empathetic. Detail-oriented.*

These are just some of the keywords that come to mind when
describing myself to others. 

Growing up next to Lake Tahoe, the Sierra Nevada mountains garnered my
inherent thirst for adventure, culture, people, and the
next life changing experience beyond the horizon.

That thirst in turn cultivates my creative ambitions asa designer, inspiring not only my projects but also my relationships with clients to innovate engaging design language rooted in messaging that tells a compelling
story. 

Like the Sierras, great design draws you in, begging to be explored.
